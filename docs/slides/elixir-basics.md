##  Elixir basics

![Elixir-logo](resources/elixir-logo.png)

* Created by Jose Valim
* Design goal
    - Utilse the awesomeness of BEAM and creat a language devs love?
    - Fail fast and recover (actors)
* Syntax
    - Ruby inspired (on the surface)

note:
    Jose got started afted reading the 7 languages book

    Erlang has a reputation of being hard to approach

    And even for experienced devs there is a lot of boilerplate ceremony
