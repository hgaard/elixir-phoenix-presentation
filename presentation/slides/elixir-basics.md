* Created by José Valim
* Full inter-operation with Erlang
* More or less shared type system with Erlang
* Ruby inspired syntax (on the surface)
* Steals great things from any language

note:
    Jose got started after reading the 7 languages book

    Erlang has a reputation of being hard to approach

    And even for experienced devs there is a lot of boilerplate ceremony

    Why: However, despite some great properties, I never was (and I’m still not) quite comfortable programming in Erlang. The coding experience somehow never felt very fluent, and the resulting code was always burdened with excessive boilerplate and duplication
