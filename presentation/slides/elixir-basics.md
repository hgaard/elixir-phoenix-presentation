* Created by Jos√© Valim
* Full inter-operation with Erlang
* More or less shared type system with Erlang
* Ruby inspired syntax (on the surface)
* Steals great things from any language

note:
    Jose got started after reading the 7 languages book

    Erlang has a reputation of being hard to approach

    And even for experienced devs there is a lot of boilerplate ceremony
