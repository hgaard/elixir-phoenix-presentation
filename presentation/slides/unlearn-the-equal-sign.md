## Unlearn the equal sign

>“Joe Armstrong, Erlang’s creator, compares the equals sign in Erlang to that used in algebra. When you write the equation x = a + 1, you are not assigning the value of a + 1 to x. Instead you’re simply asserting that the expressions x and a + 1 have the same value. If you know the value of x, you can work out the value of a, and vice versa.”

*from "Programming Elixir 1.3"*

note:
    “His point is that you had to unlearn the algebraic meaning of = when you first came across assignment in imperative programming languages. Now’s the time to un-unlearn it.”
